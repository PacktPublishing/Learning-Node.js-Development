## About the Book
Learning Node.js Development is a practical, project-based book that provides you with all you need to get started as a Node.js developer. Node is a ubiquitous technology on the modern web, and an essential part of any web developers toolkit. If you are looking to create real-world Node applications, or you want to switch careers or launch a side-project to generate some extra income, then you're in the right place. This book has been written around a single goal: turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.

The Complete Node.js Developer Course is built from the ground up around the latest version of Node.js (version 9.x.x). You'll be learning all the cutting-edge features available only in the latest software versions. 

This book cuts through the mass of information available around Node and delivers the essential skills that you need to become a node developer. It takes you through creating complete apps and understanding how to build, deploy, and test your own Node apps. It maps out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up-and-running quickly.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
console.log('Starting app.js');

const fs = require('fs');
const _ = require('lodash');
const yargs = require('yargs');
```
